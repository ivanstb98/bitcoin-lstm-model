# Bitcoin Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview

This repository presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model designed to predict future Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Leveraging historical cryptocurrency data, this project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of recurrent neural networks in time-series forecasting within the volatile financial markets. The model is trained to recognize complex patterns and dependencies in price movements, offering insights into potential future trends.
